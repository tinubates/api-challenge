1) Temperature increases as latitude decreases. This make sense because lower latitudes are closer to the equator, and thus hotter weather.
2) No clear correlation between latitude and humidity. This is perhaps because humidity is affected more by landscape type such as forest vs. desert vs. seaside; and these landscape type can exist at any latitude.
3) No clear correlation between latitude and wind. Given that wind is simply the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure regions, perhaps we should explore the relationship between latitude & high/low air pressure to better understand potential correlation.
